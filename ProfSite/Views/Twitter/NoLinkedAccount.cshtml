    <h3>Twitter for Small Business</h3>
    <hr class="plus diagonal">
    <p>Twitter is the real time, right now social tool. Twitter happens quickly and trends fly up and down in a matter of minutes. It’s also become a outlet of choice for consumers to talk to, or about, the brands they love (or hate). While major airlines and cable TV providers need to be ready 24/7 to address issues, the role of Twitter for small businesses is a little different. For your clinic, Twitter can help you:</p>
    <p>Build and reach an audience of fans—both your customers and others around the world.</p>
    <p>Establish yourself and your brand as an authority. When you tweet, others listen, and spread your words far and wide.</p>
    <p>Stay up on the latest news and trends in your field by following the experts and news sources in animal health.</p>
