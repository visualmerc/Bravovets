        <h2>CLOSE THE ADHERENCE GAP.</h2>
        <h3>HELP REDUCE TIME BETWEEN TREATMENTS WITH FEWER, EASIER DOSES.</h3>
        <p>
            Did you know that the average dog is treated for fleas and ticks only 2.8 months of the year?<sup>1</sup> What’s more, studies have found that topical, once-a-month products are used correctly in less than 12% of dogs.
            That means that dogs spend most of the year unprotected – or insufficiently protected.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Bravecto, dogs are protected from fleas and ticks for up to 12 full weeks per treatment. That’s up to 3X longer than monthly treatments – meaning fewer chances for pet owners to forget or administer treatments incorrectly.

        <h2>DRIVE OUT FLEA INFESTATIONS IN ONE CHEW.</h2>
        <p>
            When pet owners are dealing with a flea infestation, it can be around 3 months of itchy bites and obsessive cleaning. Monthly treatments add to pet owners’ stress by requiring them to reapply the treatment every 28 days for at least 3 months to ensure continuous protection as the fleas are driven out.3 And, if they accidentally forget? Months and months of pests in their home and on their dog, leading to an unhappy pet owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Bravecto’s 12-week efficacy against adult fleas, you can drive infestations within the home to extinction with just one chew.4 Bravecto breaks the flea life cycle by rapidly and effectively killing adult fleas throughout the 12-week treatment interval. This prevents the introduction of new flea eggs into the house, and, in turn, prevents emergences of new adult fleas.
        </p>
        <p>
            By disrupting the flea life cycle on the dog, Bravecto can lead to the extinction of fleas in infested environments – so pet owners can get back to enjoying more time with their dogs, flea-free.
