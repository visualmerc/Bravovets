			Share positive content. <br>
			Give engagement to receive engagement. Always respond to users’ comments. <br>
			Share images and links. <br>
			<br>
			Keep in mind these rules on engagement:<br>
			<br>
			Engagement and listening go hand in hand. Listen to your fans to determine what information they’re searching for within your industry. Fill that void with relevant content and you’ll see an increase in engagement. <br>

			Do NOT ask for shares and likes. This was common practice when brands first appeared on the Facebook scene. Now Facebook actually discourages this. Asking for likes and shares is a common practice for social novices. <br>

			To receive engagement, you must give engagement. When a fan interacts with your page, like or comment in response. Having dialogue with your fans increases their willingness to engage. Fans look for reassurance that you’re listening. <br>

			When responding to a fan, keep it friendly by using their name, “Hi (name)…” Avoid using “I” or “me,” instead use “we”; third party is more appropriate when responding for a brand. Always be grateful by ending with a “thank you.”<br>

			Stay positive – Positive content is sharable content and encourages engagement. <br>

			Tease information – Offer useful content to your fans, but don’t give it all away up front. Use your post as a teaser to click on the information your sharing (article, blog, video, etc.)<br>

			Use links – Facebook favors links as high quality content and pushes them out to more users. When including a link in your post, use Bit.ly or TInyURL to shorten your link so it doesn’t take up the entire post. <br>

			Use images – Image posts are the champions of engagement. Make sure to acquire a stock photography account and take your own photos at events or of new products whenever possible to have a variety of images as usable content. <br>

			Make your page mobile-friendly – 70% of your audience will be viewing your posts from their cell phone so make sure the links and images you share are mobile-friendly. <br>

			Give engagement to receive engagement – Creating dialogue between you and your users fosters a healthy relationship for further engagement. <br>

			Post at the right time – Your business hours may be from 9 to 5, but that may not be the time your fans are coming to your Facebook page. Determine what time your fans are on by referring to previous posts and Facebook Insights. Post your content when your fans are most likely to be on Facebook and you’ll get better engagement.<br>

			<br>
			Keep it simple – With only 140 characters for copy, it’s important to keep tweets simple and to the point. <br>

			Hashtags – Know what hashtags are trending on Twitter. Hashtags allow users to follow a conversation around a specific term or word on Twitter. Incorporating hashtags is a great way to get your content in front of new users and gain followers. <br>

			Interact with tweets – Note the options of reply, retweet and favorite, and use them. By engaging with followers, you show your brand is listening, and encourage further interactions.<br>

			Use Twitter’s search feature – Using the search feature is key to understanding what followers are already saying about your brand. Knowing what conversations are taking place around your brand will allow you to engage, respond, and create relevant content for your audience. <br>

			Provide a clear call to action – Know what you want your followers to do with your tweet and ask them to do it, i.e., check out this article, etc. <br>

			Punctuation – With only 140 characters, it may be tempting to leave out a comma, period or semicolon, but don’t do it. Punctuation is important for easy reading, even in a tweet. <br>

			Make tweets engaging – Followers engage with tweets that pose questions, or provide facts and figures. These types of tweets are sharable content. <br>

			Incorporate @mentions – This encourages followers with a large following (influencer) to engage with your brand. Engagement from an influencer can promote exposure for your brand and increase your fan base. <br>

			Retweet relevant content – By retweeting content that is pertinent to your followers, you portray yourself as helpful, and illustrate your knowledge and presence in the field. <br>

			Use links – Twitter only allots 140 characters for a tweet so when linking out to content make sure to shorten your link by using Bit.ly or TInyURL. <br>

			<br>
			To generate interesting content and increase your engagement rate, make use of images in your posts or tweets. A good way to do this is to acquire a stock photography account. Paying for stock photography will provide you with a variety of images to choose from, and guarantees you’ll have no legal issues.<br>

			When using stock images always make sure that the image relates to your target audience, edit the photo to make it your own, and don’t share an image just for the sake of sharing. Make sure it provides value to your content.<br>

			Images + copy = a perfect pair. <br>

			Videos are a fun and easy way to get a point across. Scan YouTube for appropriate videos, and share those that offer timely and relevant information with your fans. <br>

			Incorporate plenty of photos into you content. Share photos of an event you hosted at your clinic or a new product available to your clients. <br>

			Your clients love to show off their pets and you should, too. Get permission from clients to share images of their cute pooch or kitty on your Facebook page. Feature a pet of the week with an image and bio. This will drive engagement—cute animal photos almost always do—and will also illustrate to your clients that you care about their pets.<br>

			- Ensure that you are well prepared before initiating media outreach. If you have never engaged with the media, start by preparing a list of local newspapers, free sheets, local magazines, radio, television stations, websites and e-newsletters.  Conducting online research will help you in this regard, but chances are you know most of them already.  <br><br>

			- Once you have identified the appropriate news outlets for a story idea or press release, take time to familiarize yourself with the reporters or editors who cover companion animals. Buy a copy of their publication or read their prior stories online. In many cases, it’s even possible to download a “Media Pack” from each media outlet you would like to contact, which will provide you with details on editorial guidelines and submission deadlines (these are different than advertising deadlines). If you can’t get this information, telephone the publication. Most weekly news outlets need information seven days in advance, but monthlies often require a six-week or three-month lead time. Understanding precise deadlines will allow you to better plan when to send out your media information.
			<br><br><br>
			Take Action<br>
			- When you are ready, call the relevant journalist. Introduce yourself as the point of contact and explain the aim of the program. Highlight the main objective, which in this instance is to raise awareness of the importance of year-round flea and tick protection. If possible, it’s always helpful to have facts and figures at your fingertips when discussing this issue.  From the kinds of fleas and ticks that are most prevalent in your area to seasonal spikes in incidence rates, this intelligence can help reporters shape a powerful story and emphasize your points (see CICADA if available in your country, or local testing laboratory results for monitoring outbreaks in your area).<br><br>

			Inform Your Staff<br>
			- During periods of media outreach, make sure that everyone in your practice stays in the loop. Consider training your receptionist to take inbound calls from journalists, ensuring they ask the right sort of questions so you can follow up with more of the details. These should include:<br>
			<br>
			The name of the journalist and what outlet they’re reporting for<br>

			 What subject/information they are most interested in talking about<br>

			Their contact details<br>

			The deadline for a response<br>

			Identify in advance a spokesperson within your practice that will be in charge of replying to press requests and conducting media interviews. Always have a backup person for any absences.<br>

			To receive engagement, you must give engagement. When a fan interacts with your page, like or comment in response. Having dialogue with your fans increases their willingness to engage. Fans look for reassurance that you’re listening. <br>

			When responding to a fan, keep it friendly by using their name, “Hi (name)…” Avoid using “I” or “me,” instead use “we”; third party is more appropriate when responding for a brand. Always be grateful by ending with a “thank you.”<br>

			Stay positive – Positive content is sharable content and encourages engagement. <br>

			Tease information – Offer useful content to your fans, but don’t give it all away up front. Use your post as a teaser to click on the information your sharing (article, blog, video, etc.)<br>

			Use links – Facebook favors links as high quality content and pushes them out to more users. When including a link in your post, use Bit.ly or TInyURL to shorten your link so it doesn’t take up the entire post. <br>

			Use images – Image posts are the champions of engagement. Make sure to acquire a stock photography account and take your own photos at events or of new products whenever possible to have a variety of images as usable content. <br>

			Make your page mobile-friendly – 70% of your audience will be viewing your posts from their cell phone so make sure the links and images you share are mobile-friendly. <br>

			Give engagement to receive engagement – Creating dialogue between you and your users fosters a healthy relationship for further engagement. <br>

			Post at the right time – Your business hours may be from 9 to 5, but that may not be the time your fans are coming to your Facebook page. Determine what time your fans are on by referring to previous posts and Facebook Insights. Post your content when your fans are most likely to be on Facebook and you’ll get better engagement.<br>

			<br>
			Keep it simple – With only 140 characters for copy, it’s important to keep tweets simple and to the point. <br>

			Hashtags – Know what hashtags are trending on Twitter. Hashtags allow users to follow a conversation around a specific term or word on Twitter. Incorporating hashtags is a great way to get your content in front of new users and gain followers. <br>

			Interact with tweets – Note the options of reply, retweet and favorite, and use them. By engaging with followers, you show your brand is listening, and encourage further interactions.<br>

			Use Twitter’s search feature – Using the search feature is key to understanding what followers are already saying about your brand. Knowing what conversations are taking place around your brand will allow you to engage, respond, and create relevant content for your audience. <br>

			Provide a clear call to action – Know what you want your followers to do with your tweet and ask them to do it, i.e., check out this article, etc. <br>

			Punctuation – With only 140 characters, it may be tempting to leave out a comma, period or semicolon, but don’t do it. Punctuation is important for easy reading, even in a tweet. <br>

			Make tweets engaging – Followers engage with tweets that pose questions, or provide facts and figures. These types of tweets are sharable content. <br>

			Incorporate @mentions – This encourages followers with a large following (influencer) to engage with your brand. Engagement from an influencer can promote exposure for your brand and increase your fan base. <br>

			Retweet relevant content – By retweeting content that is pertinent to your followers, you portray yourself as helpful, and illustrate your knowledge and presence in the field. <br>

			<br>
			To generate interesting content and increase your engagement rate, make use of images in your posts or tweets. A good way to do this is to acquire a stock photography account. Paying for stock photography will provide you with a variety of images to choose from, and guarantees you’ll have no legal issues.<br>

			When using stock images always make sure that the image relates to your target audience, edit the photo to make it your own, and don’t share an image just for the sake of sharing. Make sure it provides value to your content.<br>

			Images + copy = a perfect pair. <br>

			Videos are a fun and easy way to get a point across. Scan YouTube for appropriate videos, and share those that offer timely and relevant information with your fans. <br>

			Incorporate plenty of photos into you content. Share photos of an event you hosted at your clinic or a new product available to your clients. <br>

			Your clients love to show off their pets and you should, too. Get permission from clients to share images of their cute pooch or kitty on your Facebook page. Feature a pet of the week with an image and bio. This will drive engagement—cute animal photos almost always do—and will also illustrate to your clients that you care about their pets.<br>

			- Ensure that you are well prepared before initiating media outreach. If you have never engaged with the media, start by preparing a list of local newspapers, free sheets, local magazines, radio, television stations, websites and e-newsletters.  Conducting online research will help you in this regard, but chances are you know most of them already.  <br><br>

			- Once you have identified the appropriate news outlets for a story idea or press release, take time to familiarize yourself with the reporters or editors who cover companion animals. Buy a copy of their publication or read their prior stories online. In many cases, it’s even possible to download a “Media Pack” from each media outlet you would like to contact, which will provide you with details on editorial guidelines and submission deadlines (these are different than advertising deadlines). If you can’t get this information, telephone the publication. Most weekly news outlets need information seven days in advance, but monthlies often require a six-week or three-month lead time. Understanding precise deadlines will allow you to better plan when to send out your media information.
			<br><br><br>
			Take Action<br>
			- When you are ready, call the relevant journalist. Introduce yourself as the point of contact and explain the aim of the program. Highlight the main objective, which in this instance is to raise awareness of the importance of year-round flea and tick protection. If possible, it’s always helpful to have facts and figures at your fingertips when discussing this issue.  From the kinds of fleas and ticks that are most prevalent in your area to seasonal spikes in incidence rates, this intelligence can help reporters shape a powerful story and emphasize your points (see CICADA if available in your country, or local testing laboratory results for monitoring outbreaks in your area).<br><br>

			Inform Your Staff<br>
			- During periods of media outreach, make sure that everyone in your practice stays in the loop. Consider training your receptionist to take inbound calls from journalists, ensuring they ask the right sort of questions so you can follow up with more of the details. These should include:<br>
			<br>
			The name of the journalist and what outlet they’re reporting for<br>

			 What subject/information they are most interested in talking about<br>

			Their contact details<br>

			What the numbers mean<br>
			<br>
			Fan growth – This is simply how many net new likes your page is gaining. Pay attention to spikes in new likes, i.e., was there a particular action you took that increased your likes?<br>
			Reach – The number of people who saw your post, either in their newsfeed or on your page. You may find that some post types receive more reach than others.<br>
			Engagement – This includes actions people take on your posts, including likes, comments, shares and clicks. Use these metrics to compare your different types of posts to determine which are doing best for your page and are resonating the most with your fans.<br>
			When your fans are online – Found under the Posts tab, this chart tells you when your fans are seeing your content. Pay attention to this so you can find the best times and days of the week to post your content.<br>

			<br>
			Keep in mind these rules on engagement:<br>
			<br>
			Engagement and listening go hand in hand. Listen to your fans to determine what information they’re searching for within your industry. Fill that void with relevant content and you’ll see an increase in engagement. <br>

			Do NOT ask for shares and likes. This was common practice when brands first appeared on the Facebook scene. Now Facebook actually discourages this. Asking for likes and shares is a common practice for social novices. <br>

			To receive engagement, you must give engagement. When a fan interacts with your page, like or comment in response. Having dialogue with your fans increases their willingness to engage. Fans look for reassurance that you’re listening. <br>

			When responding to a fan, keep it friendly by using their name, “Hi (name)…” Avoid using “I” or “me,” instead use “we”; third party is more appropriate when responding for a brand. Always be grateful by ending with a “thank you.”<br>

			Stay positive – Positive content is sharable content and encourages engagement. <br>

			Tease information – Offer useful content to your fans, but don’t give it all away up front. Use your post as a teaser to click on the information your sharing (article, blog, video, etc.)<br>

			Use links – Facebook favors links as high quality content and pushes them out to more users. When including a link in your post, use Bit.ly or TInyURL to shorten your link so it doesn’t take up the entire post. <br>

			Use images – Image posts are the champions of engagement. Make sure to acquire a stock photography account and take your own photos at events or of new products whenever possible to have a variety of images as usable content. <br>

			Make your page mobile-friendly – 70% of your audience will be viewing your posts from their cell phone so make sure the links and images you share are mobile-friendly. <br>

			Give engagement to receive engagement – Creating dialogue between you and your users fosters a healthy relationship for further engagement. <br>

			Post at the right time – Your business hours may be from 9 to 5, but that may not be the time your fans are coming to your Facebook page. Determine what time your fans are on by referring to previous posts and Facebook Insights. Post your content when your fans are most likely to be on Facebook and you’ll get better engagement.<br>

			Keep it simple – With only 140 characters for copy, it’s important to keep tweets simple and to the point. <br>

			Hashtags – Know what hashtags are trending on Twitter. Hashtags allow users to follow a conversation around a specific term or word on Twitter. Incorporating hashtags is a great way to get your content in front of new users and gain followers. <br>

			Interact with tweets – Note the options of reply, retweet and favorite, and use them. By engaging with followers, you show your brand is listening, and encourage further interactions.<br>

			Use Twitter’s search feature – Using the search feature is key to understanding what followers are already saying about your brand. Knowing what conversations are taking place around your brand will allow you to engage, respond, and create relevant content for your audience. <br>

			Provide a clear call to action – Know what you want your followers to do with your tweet and ask them to do it, i.e., check out this article, etc. <br>

			Punctuation – With only 140 characters, it may be tempting to leave out a comma, period or semicolon, but don’t do it. Punctuation is important for easy reading, even in a tweet. <br>

			Make tweets engaging – Followers engage with tweets that pose questions, or provide facts and figures. These types of tweets are sharable content. <br>

			Incorporate @mentions – This encourages followers with a large following (influencer) to engage with your brand. Engagement from an influencer can promote exposure for your brand and increase your fan base. <br>

			Retweet relevant content – By retweeting content that is pertinent to your followers, you portray yourself as helpful, and illustrate your knowledge and presence in the field. <br>

			Use links – Twitter only allots 140 characters for a tweet so when linking out to content make sure to shorten your link by using Bit.ly or TInyURL. <br>

			<br>
			To generate interesting content and increase your engagement rate, make use of images in your posts or tweets. A good way to do this is to acquire a stock photography account. Paying for stock photography will provide you with a variety of images to choose from, and guarantees you’ll have no legal issues.<br>

			When using stock images always make sure that the image relates to your target audience, edit the photo to make it your own, and don’t share an image just for the sake of sharing. Make sure it provides value to your content.<br>

			Images + copy = a perfect pair. <br>

			Videos are a fun and easy way to get a point across. Scan YouTube for appropriate videos, and share those that offer timely and relevant information with your fans. <br>

			Incorporate plenty of photos into you content. Share photos of an event you hosted at your clinic or a new product available to your clients. <br>

			Your clients love to show off their pets and you should, too. Get permission from clients to share images of their cute pooch or kitty on your Facebook page. Feature a pet of the week with an image and bio. This will drive engagement—cute animal photos almost always do—and will also illustrate to your clients that you care about their pets.<br>

			- Ensure that you are well prepared before initiating media outreach. If you have never engaged with the media, start by preparing a list of local newspapers, free sheets, local magazines, radio, television stations, websites and e-newsletters.  Conducting online research will help you in this regard, but chances are you know most of them already.  <br><br>

			- Once you have identified the appropriate news outlets for a story idea or press release, take time to familiarize yourself with the reporters or editors who cover companion animals. Buy a copy of their publication or read their prior stories online. In many cases, it’s even possible to download a “Media Pack” from each media outlet you would like to contact, which will provide you with details on editorial guidelines and submission deadlines (these are different than advertising deadlines). If you can’t get this information, telephone the publication. Most weekly news outlets need information seven days in advance, but monthlies often require a six-week or three-month lead time. Understanding precise deadlines will allow you to better plan when to send out your media information.
			<br><br><br>
			Take Action<br>
			- When you are ready, call the relevant journalist. Introduce yourself as the point of contact and explain the aim of the program. Highlight the main objective, which in this instance is to raise awareness of the importance of year-round flea and tick protection. If possible, it’s always helpful to have facts and figures at your fingertips when discussing this issue.  From the kinds of fleas and ticks that are most prevalent in your area to seasonal spikes in incidence rates, this intelligence can help reporters shape a powerful story and emphasize your points (see CICADA if available in your country, or local testing laboratory results for monitoring outbreaks in your area).<br><br>

			Inform Your Staff<br>
			- During periods of media outreach, make sure that everyone in your practice stays in the loop. Consider training your receptionist to take inbound calls from journalists, ensuring they ask the right sort of questions so you can follow up with more of the details. These should include:<br>
			<br>
			The name of the journalist and what outlet they’re reporting for<br>

			 What subject/information they are most interested in talking about<br>

			Their contact details<br>

			The deadline for a response<br>

			Identify in advance a spokesperson within your practice that will be in charge of replying to press requests and conducting media interviews. Always have a backup person for any absences.<br>

Once you’ve created your clinic’s page, individual users can then “like” you and are now “fans” of the page. They have established a connection to you and are interested in hearing from you.

			It will take time – Even if there are only 4 people who like your page in the first few weeks, you still need to show them you care. If you put in the effort to answer questions, put up content and more, they’ll reward your devotion by telling others, which is how you’ll build your audience.<br>

			A little love goes a long way – Stopping in periodically to like a fan’s post, comment on a recently posted photo of their puppy or thank them for stopping by the page will go a long way toward building a social relationship.<br>

			Do NOT ask for shares and likes. This was common practice when brands first appeared on the Facebook scene. Now Facebook actually discourages this. Asking for likes and shares is a common practice for social novices. <br>

			To receive engagement, you must give engagement. When a fan interacts with your page, like or comment in response. Having dialogue with your fans increases their willingness to engage. Fans look for reassurance that you’re listening. <br>

			When responding to a fan, keep it friendly by using their name, “Hi (name)…” Avoid using “I” or “me,” instead use “we”; third party is more appropriate when responding for a brand. Always be grateful by ending with a “thank you.”<br>

			Stay positive – Positive content is sharable content and encourages engagement. <br>

			Tease information – Offer useful content to your fans, but don’t give it all away up front. Use your post as a teaser to click on the information your sharing (article, blog, video, etc.)<br>

			Use links – Facebook favors links as high quality content and pushes them out to more users. When including a link in your post, use Bit.ly or TInyURL to shorten your link so it doesn’t take up the entire post. <br>

			Use images – Image posts are the champions of engagement. Make sure to acquire a stock photography account and take your own photos at events or of new products whenever possible to have a variety of images as usable content. <br>

			Make your page mobile-friendly – 70% of your audience will be viewing your posts from their cell phone so make sure the links and images you share are mobile-friendly. <br>

			Give engagement to receive engagement – Creating dialogue between you and your users fosters a healthy relationship for further engagement. <br>

			Post at the right time – Your business hours may be from 9 to 5, but that may not be the time your fans are coming to your Facebook page. Determine what time your fans are on by referring to previous posts and Facebook Insights. Post your content when your fans are most likely to be on Facebook and you’ll get better engagement.<br>

			<br>
			Keep it simple – With only 140 characters for copy, it’s important to keep tweets simple and to the point. <br>

			Hashtags – Know what hashtags are trending on Twitter. Hashtags allow users to follow a conversation around a specific term or word on Twitter. Incorporating hashtags is a great way to get your content in front of new users and gain followers. <br>

			Interact with tweets – Note the options of reply, retweet and favorite, and use them. By engaging with followers, you show your brand is listening, and encourage further interactions.<br>

			Use Twitter’s search feature – Using the search feature is key to understanding what followers are already saying about your brand. Knowing what conversations are taking place around your brand will allow you to engage, respond, and create relevant content for your audience. <br>

			Provide a clear call to action – Know what you want your followers to do with your tweet and ask them to do it, i.e., check out this article, etc. <br>

			Punctuation – With only 140 characters, it may be tempting to leave out a comma, period or semicolon, but don’t do it. Punctuation is important for easy reading, even in a tweet. <br>

			Make tweets engaging – Followers engage with tweets that pose questions, or provide facts and figures. These types of tweets are sharable content. <br>

			Incorporate @mentions – This encourages followers with a large following (influencer) to engage with your brand. Engagement from an influencer can promote exposure for your brand and increase your fan base. <br>

			Retweet relevant content – By retweeting content that is pertinent to your followers, you portray yourself as helpful, and illustrate your knowledge and presence in the field. <br>

			Use links – Twitter only allots 140 characters for a tweet so when linking out to content make sure to shorten your link by using Bit.ly or TInyURL. <br>

			<br>
			To generate interesting content and increase your engagement rate, make use of images in your posts or tweets. A good way to do this is to acquire a stock photography account. Paying for stock photography will provide you with a variety of images to choose from, and guarantees you’ll have no legal issues.<br>

			When using stock images always make sure that the image relates to your target audience, edit the photo to make it your own, and don’t share an image just for the sake of sharing. Make sure it provides value to your content.<br>

			Images + copy = a perfect pair. <br>

			Videos are a fun and easy way to get a point across. Scan YouTube for appropriate videos, and share those that offer timely and relevant information with your fans. <br>

			Incorporate plenty of photos into you content. Share photos of an event you hosted at your clinic or a new product available to your clients. <br>

			Your clients love to show off their pets and you should, too. Get permission from clients to share images of their cute pooch or kitty on your Facebook page. Feature a pet of the week with an image and bio. This will drive engagement—cute animal photos almost always do—and will also illustrate to your clients that you care about their pets.<br>

			- Ensure that you are well prepared before initiating media outreach. If you have never engaged with the media, start by preparing a list of local newspapers, free sheets, local magazines, radio, television stations, websites and e-newsletters.  Conducting online research will help you in this regard, but chances are you know most of them already.  <br><br>

			- Once you have identified the appropriate news outlets for a story idea or press release, take time to familiarize yourself with the reporters or editors who cover companion animals. Buy a copy of their publication or read their prior stories online. In many cases, it’s even possible to download a “Media Pack” from each media outlet you would like to contact, which will provide you with details on editorial guidelines and submission deadlines (these are different than advertising deadlines). If you can’t get this information, telephone the publication. Most weekly news outlets need information seven days in advance, but monthlies often require a six-week or three-month lead time. Understanding precise deadlines will allow you to better plan when to send out your media information.
			<br><br><br>
			Take Action<br>
			- When you are ready, call the relevant journalist. Introduce yourself as the point of contact and explain the aim of the program. Highlight the main objective, which in this instance is to raise awareness of the importance of year-round flea and tick protection. If possible, it’s always helpful to have facts and figures at your fingertips when discussing this issue.  From the kinds of fleas and ticks that are most prevalent in your area to seasonal spikes in incidence rates, this intelligence can help reporters shape a powerful story and emphasize your points (see CICADA if available in your country, or local testing laboratory results for monitoring outbreaks in your area).<br><br>

			Inform Your Staff<br>
			- During periods of media outreach, make sure that everyone in your practice stays in the loop. Consider training your receptionist to take inbound calls from journalists, ensuring they ask the right sort of questions so you can follow up with more of the details. These should include:<br>
			<br>
			The name of the journalist and what outlet they’re reporting for<br>

			 What subject/information they are most interested in talking about<br>

			Their contact details<br>

			The deadline for a response<br>

			Identify in advance a spokesperson within your practice that will be in charge of replying to press requests and conducting media interviews. Always have a backup person for any absences.<br>

			Facebook offers a plethora of information in your Insights dashboard. As you’re starting out, here are the most important metrics to pay attention to: fan growth, reach, engagement (likes, comments, shares) and when your fans are online.<br><br>

			Once you get more comfortable with using Facebook, you can use Insights to dig deeper into your page’s performance.

			What the numbers mean<br>
			<br>
			Fan growth – This is simply how many net new likes your page is gaining. Pay attention to spikes in new likes, i.e., was there a particular action you took that increased your likes?<br>
			Reach – The number of people who saw your post, either in their newsfeed or on your page. You may find that some post types receive more reach than others.<br>
			Engagement – This includes actions people take on your posts, including likes, comments, shares and clicks. Use these metrics to compare your different types of posts to determine which are doing best for your page and are resonating the most with your fans.<br>
			When your fans are online – Found under the Posts tab, this chart tells you when your fans are seeing your content. Pay attention to this so you can find the best times and days of the week to post your content.<br>
